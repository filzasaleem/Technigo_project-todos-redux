# Project Todos

We started out by setting up a Trello board for all of the goals for this week. We made a quick mockup och the design in Figma, decided on which components to use as well the structure of our global state.

After that we split up the basic requirement task between ourselves and finsihed them, focusing on mostly function and not spending too much time on design.

After the basic requirements were done, we assessed the stretch goals for this project and divided them between us. Then we met up again at the end of the week and went through the app and finsihed up the design together.

## The problem

We had a pretty ambitious time table  for the project and we did have to omit a few of the stretch goals in order to finsih on time. We were happy with what we accomplished in a relatively short time but had we had more time, we would have implemented styled components (which was one of the stretch goals). The CSS ended up a little messy in the end and highlights the need to manage styling in a less confusing way.

## Technologies used for solution
React redux is used in this project. All the reducers are written by the gropu members.
